## Workflow

### Summary

The Second Closet Engineering team workflow loosely follows the [AGILE SCRUM methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management). We currently work with 1 week sprints where it is kicked off with a 1 hour **Sprint planning** meeting at the beginning of the week and end with a 1 hour **Retrospective and Demo** meeting at the end of the week. Every morning at 10 AM, we have a stand up meeting with our respective teams (FE and BE).

### Stand up

Every morning, the team needs to report on the following items on the Slack #topic-standup channel.

1. What did you accomplish since the last check-in? (Include ticket numbers).
2. What are you working on next? (Include ticket numbers).
3. What's your status moving forward? (Blockers?).

The goal of this meeting is to ensure you have a plan for the day and notify the team of anyone or anything is blocking you from moving forward. You report your daily stand up answers in the thread the relates to your team. If there is no thread, then it's your lucky day, help the team out by starting one! Here's the format: `DD-MMM-YYYY - Team [name]`
